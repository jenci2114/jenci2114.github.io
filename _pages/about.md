I'm Jenci, a full-time engineering analyst at Goldman Sachs. Graduated from the University of Toronto with a 4.00/4.00 cumulative GPA, my primary focus is on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My passion in this field has been a driving force throughout my academic journey. Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Goldman Sachs' Engineering team. Currently, I am channeling my interest in AI into a research project on computational histopathology, under the guidance of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html">Prof. Rahul G. Krishnan</a> at the Vector Institute. In this project, I analyzed histopathology slides and patient information from four cohorts using advanced machine learning techniques, employing large models such as HIPT, QUILT, and UNI to embed slides, followed by applying a vision transformer for specific tasks. I also implemented attention rollout to identify areas of focus during embedding generation and applied causal inference techniques to assess treatment effects across cohorts.
