I'm Jenci, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, where my primary focus is on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My passion in this field has been a driving force throughout my academic journey. Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Goldman Sachs' Engineering team. Currently, I am channeling my interest in AI into a research project on computational histopathology, under the guidance of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html">Prof. Rahul G. Krishnan</a>. In this project, I am exploring how computer vision techniques can be used to analyze medical images.
