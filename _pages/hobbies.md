Beyond my academic and tech endeavours, one of my greatest passions is music, particularly classical piano. During my free time, I enjoy playing the piano. I've achieved an ARCT in Piano Performance (with first class honours) a few years ago. This journey with music has been incredibly rewarding, and it continues to be a significant part of my life. I love exploring and sharing classical music, which led me to curate <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/rr7law95bbjsipamtxz1bktk0?si=404fe120e73b48e2">extensive playlists</a> featuring 100+ hours of diverse compositions. I've also attempted composing a <a href="/assets/pdf/first.pdf">short piano piece</a>, where you can listen <a href="/assets/audio/first.wav">here</a> :)

Outside of my time spent on research and studying, I enjoy playing badminton and swimming. I achieved the national lifeguard certification (pool and waterpark) when I was in high school. During the winter months, skiing becomes my sport of choice. My favourite skiing destination is Whistler Blackcomb.
