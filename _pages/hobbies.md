Beyond my academic and tech endeavours, one of my greatest passions is music, particularly classical piano. During my free time, I enjoy playing the piano. I've achieved an ARCT in Piano Performance (with first class honours) a few years ago. This journey with music has been incredibly rewarding, and it continues to be a significant part of my life. I love exploring and sharing classical music, which led me to curate <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/rr7law95bbjsipamtxz1bktk0?si=404fe120e73b48e2">extensive playlists</a> featuring 100+ hours of diverse compositions. I've also attempted composing a <a href="/assets/pdf/first.pdf" target="_blank">short piano piece</a>, where you can listen <a href="/assets/audio/first.wav" target="_blank">here</a> :)

The piano pieces that I am currently working on are
<ul>
    <li>Chopin's <i>Fantaisie Op. 49</i> (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7vCKdqXBdZQOm06iD9kbUp?si=f2b5cc8ffd1641cc">spotify link</a>)</li>
    <li>Beethoven's <i>Sonata No. 23 "Appassionata"</i> (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5ZjIF0L4cisqHy8Hd07V6k?si=54bc4e4a05f94f7c">mvt. I</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1zZ4fosLVxFXwsPXBuNp4n?si=c4afd8a393ef49ec">mvt. II</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/77ZoOb4JI4dKSAHGTOCu7A?si=41857efdba3e4477">mvt. III</a>)</li>
</ul>
Upon request, I could play those for you!

Outside of my time spent on research and studying, I enjoy playing badminton and swimming. I achieved the national lifeguard certification (pool and waterpark) when I was in high school. During the winter months, skiing becomes my sport of choice. My favourite skiing destination is Whistler Blackcomb.
